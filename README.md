# Lastfm-Dashboard

A small personal dashboard that visualizes Last.fm listening data.
Built as a weekend project to make music consumption more tangible again.

Uses the Last.fm API to display listening stats and recent tracks.
Designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with optional e-ink or small displays.

This project is intentionally simple and meant for personal use and experimentation.
It was optimized to run on an HDMI square screen, with 480x480px.

Adhjustments should be made, if your project should run on a 480x380 screen.
The script should be set in autostart, to enable opening upon bootup.

### Why this exists

This project started as a small weekend experiment.
I wanted to make music consumption feel more intentional again
and turn abstract listening data into something tangible.

It’s not meant to be perfect - just meaningful.
